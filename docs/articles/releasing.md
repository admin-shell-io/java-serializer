# Versioning

We version using **semantic versioning** (e.g., `1.0.4`). The first position indicates the major release. Different major releases canvas contain breaking changes and are not necessarily compliant. The second number indicates the minor releas or revision, which contains new features compared to an older revision. The last position is used for hotfixes or bugfixes.

Note, that the versioning scheme of this project is not directly aligned with the release process of the metamodel! For instance, the version 1.0.3 targets the metamodel version 3.0.RC02
